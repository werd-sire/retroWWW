<!-- Personal Statement -->
<div class="timeline">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #4682B4;">Personal Statement</h3>
<p><i>"My transition from intelligence professional to transparency advocate reflects a fundamental belief that democratic governance requires informed citizenship. Having spent fifteen years within the intelligence community, I understand both the legitimate needs for secrecy and the essential requirements for accountability.</i></p>

<p><i>The Federal Watch Archive represents my commitment to bridging these worlds - applying professional analytical standards to questions of public interest, while maintaining the objectivity and rigor that effective oversight demands. Democracy works best when citizens have access to factual, well-researched information about their government's operations."</i></p>
