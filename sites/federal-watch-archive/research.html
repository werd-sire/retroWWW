</div>

<div class="status-ongoing">
<h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #006400;">Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: Government Response and Accountability</h4>
<p><span class="status ongoing">Status: Document Collection Phase</span> • <strong>Started:</strong> August 1999 • <strong>Expected Completion:</strong> December 2000</p>

<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br>

<strong>Contractor Oversight:</strong> Government accountability for classified aerospace research contracts<br>
<strong>Classification Policy:</strong> Consistency in applying national security exemptions to UAP-related materials</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Observations:</strong><br>
Significant gaps in oversight of classified aerospace programs. Inconsistent application of FOIA exemptions across similar UAP-related requests suggests need for standardized declassification criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Air Force Historical Research Agency, National Archives, congressional hearing transcripts, GAO reports on aerospace contracting</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong><br>
Cross-agency evaluation of Inspector General offices' impact on federal accountability since the 1978 IG Act. Analysis covers 21 years of IG operations across 12 major federal agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Key Research Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How effective are IG offices in identifying and preventing waste, fraud, and abuse?</li>
<li>What factors contribute to IG office effectiveness variations?</li>
<li>How do IG recommendations translate into actual policy changes?</li>
<li>What structural reforms might improve IG effectiveness?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Methodology:</strong><br>
Quantitative analysis of IG report recommendations and implementation rates, supplemented by interviews with current and former IG officials and agency leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Conclusions:</strong><br>
Significant variation in IG effectiveness correlates with agency culture, leadership support, and resource allocation. Recommendations include structural reforms to enhance independence.</p>
</div>

<div class="status-review">
<h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #B8860B;">FOIA Implementation Comparative Study</h4>
<p><span class="status review">Status: External Review</span> • <strong>Research Completed:</strong> October 1999 • <strong>Publication:</strong> December 1999</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong><br>
Examination of Freedom of Information Act compliance and processing variations across federal agencies. Analysis includes processing times, exemption usage, and appeal success rates.</p>

<p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong><br>
Comprehensive statistical analysis of FOIA annual reports (1990-1998) from 25 major federal agencies. Includes trend analysis and identification of best practices.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong><br>
Substantial disparities in processing times and exemption interpretations across agencies. Some agencies consistently outperform others in transparency metrics, suggesting procedural improvements could be standardized.</p>
